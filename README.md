# NZ-Tenancy-Generator
This project is a full-stack Tenancy Agreement Generator built using .NET (backend) and Angular (frontend), tailored for New Zealand tenancy standards. It allows users to dynamically create, preview, and download legally structured tenancy agreements by inputting relevant property and tenant details.
